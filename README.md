Dynamic.Chat aims to be an easy to use efficient and secure LAN chatting system. Using a brute-force oriented security (XOR encryption) with a user defined encryption key, broadcasted UDP messages to prevent tracing down who receives the message and who doesn't.
*This Dyanmic product is part of Dynamic.\* products line*

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Usage

Simply download the latest release (with your prefered language, French or English) and simply double click the exe file!

## üåü Features & Functionalities

- Send encrypted messages over a LAN network
- Send/receive messages from different clients
- XOR + Password encryption
- Change encryption key
- Add other users encryption keys
- Change broadcast address

## ü§î How does it work ?

- Client side (send):
  When starting Dynamic.Chat an encryption key is created using the current Windows session's username and the current seconds (time).
  That encryption key is saved and used to encrypt outgoing messages using a XOR encryption.
  After the message is encrypted, its broadcasted on port 888/UDP on a LAN scale.

- Server side (receive):
  When starting Dynamic.Chat the listening server is started on a new thread an runs in the background.
  It listens to all available addresses on port 888/UDP.
  When receiving a message on that port, it will try and decrypt the packet's messages using the provided encryption keys (using 'addmdp').
  If the decryption succeeds, the beginning of the message will start with "IDENT=thekeyusedtodecrypt" which confirms that the message has been decrypted correctly.
  After the decryption succeeded, the sender's username is extract from the packet's message in the field "USER=senderusername". The username is defined based on the sender's Windows session username.
  Finally we extract the message and format it in the following format "current time | sender's username: sender's message", the message is then displayed to the console.

## üîî Releases/Updates
